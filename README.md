## Multicellular in-silico model reconstruction

# Description
This project presents a functional multicellular in-silico model reconstruction method Its files were developed using a bespoke human genome constraint-based reconstruction workflow that combines aspects from an updated mCADRE & Metabotools algorithms, the novel redHuman algorithm, along with 13C-metabolic flux analysis. 

The project aims to reproduce vital metabolic behaviours of in-vitro models in in-silico models, including cell growth predictions, respiration rates, and observations that suggest cross-shuttling of redox-active metabolites between cells.

# How to Use
The in-silico model reconstruction files can be accessed and used by running the provided scripts aloong with the latest version of the human metabolic network matrix (Recon3D).
