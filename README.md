## Multicellular in-silico model reconstruction

# Description
This project presents a functional multicellular in-silico model reconstruction method. <br /> 
Its files were developed using a bespoke human genome constraint-based reconstruction workflow that <br />
combines aspects from an updated mCADRE & Metabotools algorithms, the novel redHuman algorithm, along with <br />
13C-metabolic flux analysis. 

The project aims to reproduce vital metabolic behaviours of in-vitro models in in-silico models, <br />
including cell growth predictions, respiration rates, and observations that suggest cross-shuttling <br />
of redox-active metabolites between cells.<br />

This repository contains: <br /> 
The mCADRE algorithm updated and optimised by Elias Vera-Siguenza. <br />

COnstraint-Based Reconstruction (COBRA - 2.39.2) <br />
IBM CPLEX_Studio <br />
MATLAB Bioinformatics Toolbox <br />
AffymetrixÂ® CDF Data File Formats: The CDF file describes the layout for an Affymetrix GeneChip array. <br />

Note: <br />
IBM CPLEX has stopped its support for MATLAB since version 12.10, <br />
therefore VFFVA can be an alternative to access new CPLEX versions <br />
through its C API - instructions on how to achieve this can be found <br />
here: https://github.com/marouenbg/VFFVA <br />

This document is based on the original mCADRE workflow. <br />
Briefly, the mCADRE is an algorithm aimed at reconstructing genome-scale  <br />
metabolic models for human tissues. It involves a data-driven approach  <br />
to create tissue-specific metabolic models. The algorithm utilizes gene  <br />
expression data, protein-protein interaction networks, and metabolic  <br />
pathway information to create tissue-specific metabolic models.  <br />
The resulting models can be used to predict metabolic fluxes,  <br />
simulate metabolic perturbations, and identify potential drug targets  <br />
specific to each tissue. The mCADRE approach allows for a comprehensive  <br />
understanding of tissue-specific metabolism. From its inception, it was  <br />
originally designed for use with the global knowledgebase of metabolic  <br />
functions categorized for the human genome (Human Recon 1).  <br />

metabolic models for 126 human tissues using mCADRE.  <br />

The purpose of this MATLAB library is to provide an updated version of  <br />
the original mCADRE. Our library has been developed to improve its  <br />
applicability and it has been optimised for its implementation with the  <br />
Recon3D metabolic network model (the latest iteration of Recon models).  <br />
This updated version also implements very fast flux variability analysis,  <br />
which allows for more efficient prediction of metabolic fluxes and  <br />
identification of metabolic targets. By incorporating the Recon3D model,  <br />
the updated mCADRE algorithm includes additional metabolic reactions and  <br />
pathways, leading to a more comprehensive analysis of metabolic networks  <br />
through a computationally less expensive algorithm; i.e., in less time.  <br />
Overall, the updated mCADRE algorithm is expected to optimise an already   <br />
accurate and efficient tool for predicting metabolic behavior and  <br />
identifying potential drug targets. <br />
