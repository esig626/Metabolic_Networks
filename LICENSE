% This document is based on the original mCADRE workflow.
% Briefly, the mCADRE is an algorithm aimed at reconstructing genome-scale 
% metabolic models for human tissues. It involves a data-driven approach 
% to create tissue-specific metabolic models. The algorithm utilizes gene 
% expression data, protein-protein interaction networks, and metabolic 
% pathway information to create tissue-specific metabolic models. 
% The resulting models can be used to predict metabolic fluxes, 
% simulate metabolic perturbations, and identify potential drug targets 
% specific to each tissue. The mCADRE approach allows for a comprehensive 
% understanding of tissue-specific metabolism. From its inception, it was 
% originally designed for use with the global knowledgebase of metabolic 
% functions categorized for the human genome (Human Recon 1).

% The purpose of this MATLAB library is to provide an updated version of 
% the original mCADRE. Our library has been developed to improve its 
% applicability and it has been optimised for its implementation with the 
% Recon3D metabolic network model (the latest iteration of Recon models). 
% This updated version also implements very fast flux variability analysis, 
% which allows for more efficient prediction of metabolic fluxes and 
% identification of metabolic targets. By incorporating the Recon3D model, 
% the updated mCADRE algorithm includes additional metabolic reactions and 
% pathways, leading to a more comprehensive analysis of metabolic networks 
% through a computationally less expensive algorithm; i.e., in less time. 
% Overall, the updated mCADRE algorithm is expected to optimise an already  
% accurate and efficient tool for predicting metabolic behavior and 
% identifying potential drug targets.
